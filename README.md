Following the Oxford course in deep learning applied to NLP: https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017

I use Plotly which doesn't render on Github so here are links to the NBviewer renderer for those who might be interested:
- [Practical 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lomereiter/deepnlp/blob/master/practical1/Practical%201.ipynb)
